## Introduction

Aim to set up a Django Application with Async capabilities using Celery. Django, Redis. Logging framework and Deployment using Docker.

## Objective

Our task is to enhance the functionality and reliability of the recipe application, preparing it for a scalable and maintainable production deployment.

## Requirements

1. **Docker Integration**: Containerize the application using Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across environments.
2. **Testing and Coverage Report**: Write comprehensive test cases for all APIs and generate a coverage report to ensure robustness.
3. **Asynchronous Task Handling with Celery**: Integrate Celery to manage asynchronous tasks, particularly for background processing.
4. **Email Queue Implementation**: Build an email queue to send notifications asynchronously, including a daily notification to authors about the likes received on their recipes.
5. **Logging Framework (Bonus)**: Implement a logging framework to capture and log execution details into files for debugging and monitoring purposes.
6. **API Improvements (Bonus)**: Update APIs to use Viewsets and implement pagination for list APIs to enhance performance and usability.
7. **Performance Optimization (Bonus)**: Optimize the performance of querysets to improve the applicationâ€™s efficiency.
